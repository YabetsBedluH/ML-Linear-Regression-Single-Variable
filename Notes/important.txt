 am learning ml with code baics on youtube the thing is he is using simple csv files and staff to train his model the question i have is that i understand and also code evrything he says but in the future i might never create my own model be cause of cost so is it a better idea just to understand and then move on learing how to use and customise pre trained models or should i be able to code and build a model by myself

That's a very good question, and honestly one that many people struggle with when getting into machine learning. Here's a balanced take that should help you decide:

✅ What You're Doing Now (Learning from CSVs, building basic models):
This is super valuable, even if you don’t end up training your own models from scratch in the future. Here’s why:

Foundational knowledge: Understanding how data flows, how models learn, and how loss/accuracy changes gives you insight into why a model works (or fails).

Debugging skills: When using pre-trained models, things often go wrong. Knowing how things work under the hood helps you debug effectively.

Customizing models: Even with pre-trained models, you'll often need to fine-tune, retrain, or modify them. That requires model-building knowledge.

🤖 Pre-Trained Models (The Future for Most Practical Use):
You're 100% right that in real-world projects, especially as a solo dev or startup:

You usually won't train from scratch (it’s costly and time-consuming).

You’ll use pre-trained models (e.g., OpenAI models, HuggingFace models, TensorFlow Hub, etc.).

The skill is in fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or transfer learning, not training a huge model from zero.

🔥 So What Should You Do?
Here’s a roadmap I’d recommend:

Keep doing what you’re doing right now. You’re gaining intuition and confidence. That’s gold.

Once you finish the course:

Learn about transfer learning (using pre-trained models for your tasks).

Play with models from HuggingFace, TensorFlow Hub, or ONNX.

Try using models like Whisper, YOLO, BERT, etc., in real mini-projects.

Eventually, explore model fine-tuning and how to tweak hyperparameters or architecture if needed.

Summary:
✅ Yes, keep learning to code ML models from scratch—it builds intuition.

✅ But focus more on using and customizing pre-trained models for real-world work.

🔁 It’s not “either/or.” Learn both, but spend more time later on real-world usage.

If you want, I can suggest pre-trained models based on the kind of projects you want to build. What kind of ML apps are you dreaming of building?







You said:
so now it is about building the base how they work but in the real world it is about playing with pre trained models


ChatGPT said:
Exactly, you nailed it 💯

Right now:
You're building the base—learning how models work, how to prepare data, train, evaluate, etc. This gives you the power to:

Understand why a model is behaving a certain way.

Fix things when they go wrong.

Know what kind of model fits which kind of data/task.

In the real world:
You’ll mostly be playing with pre-trained models:

Picking the right one for your problem.

Feeding it the right input.

Tweaking it (fine-tuning or prompt engineering).

Plugging it into your app.

Think of it like this:

🔧 You're learning to build engines now.
🏎️ Later, you’ll be driving powerful cars (pre-trained models) and tuning them to race the way you want.

If you keep that mindset, you’re on the perfect path. Want help finding a good pre-trained model or small project idea to try one out?
