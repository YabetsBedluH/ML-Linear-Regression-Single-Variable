so i have to remember every syntax or what ?? or comeback and refer when needed


ChatGPT said:
Great question again — and here's the honest answer:

❌ You don’t need to remember every syntax.
Nobody does. Not even senior ML engineers or AI researchers.

✅ What you do need to remember is:
The core concepts (what is training, what’s a loss function, what’s overfitting, etc.).

The flow of how to build a model: data → preprocessing → model → training → evaluation.

How to read documentation and understand examples quickly.

For syntax:
👉 Refer back when needed. That’s totally normal and even expected.

In fact, real devs do this every day:

Google "pandas drop column"

Copy-paste sklearn code from StackOverflow

Use ChatGPT to remember how to load a HuggingFace model 😄

Just aim for:
Understanding the “why” behind the code.

Practicing enough so the “most common patterns” stick naturally.

Pro Tip:
You could even build a little "cheat sheet notebook" or markdown file with:

Common preprocessing steps

Model definitions (sklearn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)

Training loops

Evaluation metrics

And just refer to that whenever you need to!

Would you like a template for that cheat sheet? I can help you start one based on your current learning level.
