Not bad at all, bro — that’s actually how most people start! 🙌

In fact, you’re doing it the right way if you:

Start with an ML course (like you're doing now),

Use the libraries as needed in the course,

Then go back and learn the libraries deeper when you feel the need or want to get better.

💡 Think of it like this:
You don’t need to master a hammer before building a house.

You learn the tool as you build.

So if you’ve never used pandas, numpy, or matplotlib before and you're seeing them in an ML project...
✅ That’s normal
✅ That’s how you learn
✅ That’s not a problem

🔄 Ideal Flow:
🛠 Use it in a project/tutorial (like house price prediction)

🤨 Ask: what’s this df.head() doing?

🔍 Look it up or practice the library a bit

📈 Next time you use it, it clicks faster

That’s why courses like Codebasics are great — they teach you the tools by using them, not just showing theory.

🧠 Pro Tip:
If you ever find a line of code that confuses you, like:

python
Copy
Edit
df.groupby('City')['Price'].mean()
👉 Just take 10 minutes to search:
“pandas groupby mean” → read or try an example → boom! 💥 You’ve learned it.

TL;DR:
No, it’s not bad if you didn’t learn the libraries before.

You’ll learn by using, not just reading.

You can always pause, go learn a bit, then continue.

That’s how real developers learn.
